# __Space-Invaders__
A simple space invaders clone created in racket (in the lisp-scheme family) using a purely functional approach.

This was created for an assignment ([link here, click 'Assignment 8']http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/skotthe/classes/cs5001/Fall/2016/module5.html) that I had a lot of fun with.
